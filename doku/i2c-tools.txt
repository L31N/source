the i2c-tools are useful to debug the i2c-buses...

install i2c-tools:
	* navigate to i2c-tools directory
	* $ make all
	* # make install
	
	* # nano /etc/ld.so.conf
		* type: "/usr/local/lib"

uninstall i2c-tools:
	* # make uninstall

use i2c-tools:
	# i2cdetect -r 2	(the -r option is required on beagleboard, the 2 means /dev/i2c-2)
